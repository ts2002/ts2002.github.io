Hi, I am a Senior studying Computer Science and Data Science. I am from South Carolina, but I grew up mainly in Maryland. I have two dogs, Gustav and Jake.

(He came with the name)

Jake:

In my free time I like reading, drawing, video games and spending time outdoors. 

## Data Projects
I am involved with two research labs on W&M's campus, AidData and GeoLab.

For AidData:

In Summer 2022 I worked on restructuring an internally used article classifier used in a research pipeline that analyzed text within news documents to see if it matched a certain relevant theme or not. I worked on feature engineering with the existing dataset to improve results and utilized artificial data augmentation to help resolve a class imbalance. I also experimented with several different model classifier types and processing pipelines to improve results. I facilitated the transfer of the machine environment to William & Mary's HPC servers to allow for high-volume article inputs and to reduce processing time. 

Since then, I have acted as the maintainer for the classifier and have pivoted to more of a development focused position. Last semester I helped create [this](https://china.aiddata.org/) dashboard which displays several different data visualizations and statistics. 

For geoLab:

My first semester with geoLab I researched and helped implement tools to summarize large text documents for research purposes. Since then I have mainly worked as a web developer to help develop the interface for the machine learning and database tools.

## Research Interests

I am interested in combining software engineering and machine learning to help create easy to use tools. In the field of machine learning, I am particularly interested in feature engineering and how it can improve models. I also enjoy data analysis and creating visualizations.
